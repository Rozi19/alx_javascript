<h1>0. Rectangle #0</h1>
<br>
Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
<br>
You must use the class notation for defining your class<br>
<h1>1. Rectangle #1</h1>
<br>
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
<br>
You must use the class notation for defining your class<br>
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h<br>
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w<br>
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h<br>
<h1>2. Rectangle #2</h1>
<br>
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
<br>
You must use the class notation for defining your class<br>
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h<br>
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w<br>
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h<br>
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object<br>
<h1>3. Rectangle #3</h1>
<br>
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
<br>
You must use the class notation for defining your class<br>
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h<br>
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w<br>
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h<br>
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object<br>
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X<br>

<h1>4. Rectangle #4</h1>
<br>
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
<br>
You must use the class notation for defining your class
<br>The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
<br>Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
<br>Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
<br>If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
<br>Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
<br>Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
<br>Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2
<br>

<h1>5. Square #0</h1>
<br>
Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:
<br>
You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends<br>
The constructor must take 1 argument: size<br>
The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super())<br>
<h1>6. Square #1</h1>
<br>
Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js:
<br>
You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends<br>
Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c<br>
If c is undefined, use the character X<br>
