<br>
Implement JavaScript validation to check the password strength when the form is submitted.<br>
Retrieve the value entered in the password input field using JavaScript.<br>
Your JavaScript should be written in a separate file and used as an external script in the HTML code
<br>
Write a function called validatePassword to validate the password based on the provided criteria.
<br>
The validatePassword function should check the following criteria:
<br>
The password must be at least 8 characters long.
<br>
The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
<br>
The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
<br>
The password must contain at least one numeric digit.
<br>
The password must contain at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).
<br>
If the password meets all the criteria, allow the form submission.
<br>
If the password does not meet the criteria, display an appropriate error message in the <p> element with the id “error” .
